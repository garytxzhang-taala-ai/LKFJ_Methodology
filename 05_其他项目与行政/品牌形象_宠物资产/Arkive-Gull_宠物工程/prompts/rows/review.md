Create one horizontal animation strip for Codex pet `arkive-gull`, state `review`.

Use the attached canonical base for identity. Use the attached layout guide only for slot count, spacing, centering, and padding; do not draw the guide.

Output exactly 6 full-body frames in one left-to-right row on flat pure green #00FF00. Treat the row as 6 invisible equal-width slots: one centered complete pose per slot, evenly spaced, with no overlap, clipping, empty slots, labels, or borders.

Identity: same pet in every frame: Very close to the approved pixel mascot. White chubby round bird, tiny tuft, orange beak and feet, gray wings, bright royal-blue scarf with a simple chest badge. Personality is cute, slightly cheeky, and confident. Some states may wear small black sunglasses, especially cool or relaxed poses, but many core states should be without sunglasses so the face stays expressive.. Preserve silhouette, face, proportions, markings, palette, material, style, and props.
Style: Pet-safe sprite: compact full-body mascot, readable in a 192x208 cell, clear silhouette, simple face, stable palette/materials, and crisp edges for chroma-key extraction. Style `pixel`: Pixel-art-adjacent digital mascot with a chunky silhouette, simple dark outline, limited palette, flat cel shading, and visible stepped edges. User style notes: Polished 16-bit pixel mascot sprite, compact silhouette, consistent proportions, clean readable pixel clusters, mascot-safe and animation-friendly..
Animation continuity: keep apparent pet scale and baseline stable within the row unless the state itself intentionally changes vertical position, such as `jumping`. Move the pose within the slot instead of redrawing the pet larger or smaller frame to frame.

State action: Ready-review loop: focused inspection of completed output with lean, blink, narrowed eyes, head tilt, or paw pose.

State requirements:
- Show review through lean, blink, narrowed eyes, head tilt, or paw/hand position.
- Do not add magnifying glasses, papers, code, UI, punctuation, symbols, or other new props unless they already exist in the base pet identity.

Clean extraction: crisp opaque edges, safe padding, no scenery, text, guide marks, checkerboard, shadows, glows, motion blur, speed lines, dust, detached effects, stray pixels, or chroma-key colors inside the pet.
